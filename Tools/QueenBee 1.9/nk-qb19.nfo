                  Queen Bee (PAK / QB Explorer, Editor)


This explorer / editor allows you to modify QB files contained in PAK/PAB
files.

Queen Bee is a PAK / QB Explorer, Editor.

Please read the information on these tabs.  Coders hate documenting so if they
take the time to write something the least you can do is read it  ;-)

This application will help everyone discover lots of great hacks.  See the text
file included with this release for some areas of interest (after only half an
hour of casually browsing).

Due to this application being so generic it can be tedious to use if you have a
lot of changes to make. The internal core is designed to be used to build
specific item editors very easily (like the already existing Song List editor). 
Although the source code is not included I do plan to release it, just not yet. 
I want to ensure the core is correct and stable so that if people use it they
won't need to restructure code because of QB core keeps changes.


Quick Feature List:-
- Supports Wii / PS2 / PC / XBox files.
- Edits a PAK's QB file in memory (No Import / Export required).
- Import / Export / Export All functionality for PAK files.
- Create New / Add / Rename / Remove files in PAK files.
- Supports all internal QB structures contained in Guitar Hero 3 / Aerosmith /
     World Tour / Metallica / Smash Hits / Greatest Hits /
     Tony Hawk's Proving Ground and Downhill Jam.
- QB structure and array items can be created, removed, copied and pasted.
- All items are editable including increasing the size of text and script items.
- Array items can be saved to text files for easy editing.
- Debug files are supported to help describe the QB file structures.
- QB files are Bit perfect if loaded and saved without changes even though the
     file has been broken down and fully rebuilt.
- Saves and Restores settings.
- Search Facility (String, QB Key and Numeric).


Wish List:-
- Load QB files without PAK/PAB.
- Seamless Qs support.
- Better support for WPC / XBX files.


Technical Notes:-
- Internal QB pointers are not used when loading files, instead they are used to
     validate the file is not corrupt.
- This application was developed to allow other developers to use the code in
     their code.
- The code will be released when I'm happy this app functions correctly and all
     the data types are correct.


Respect to ALL who contribute to the following:-
- Console Reversing.
- Homebrew.
- Scene News.
- Custom Guitar Hero Discs (Any Console).
Your efforts and time are appreciated.


Thanks to GameZelda for releasing code for the apps he writes and always being an
endless source of technical information.

Thanks to the guys behind RawkSD for using the Queen Bee parser and helping making
this project worth the effort.
