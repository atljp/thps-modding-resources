from my understanding THAW's skeleton is extremely similar to THUG2's with there being differences in how the arms work 
and by extention which order the bones come in, the skeleton gets 2 new bones for the upper arms

For rigging to THUG2's skeleton, the weight's shouldve converted with the model, but those are bones are gonna be a pain,
now there is a way to merge vertex groups however it's not all too great 
but with it you could combine all 3 and set them to the THUG2 proper upper arm bones
What I do is just delete the 2 added bones and the 3 that replace the alt shoulder bone
then I weight transfer weights from a THUG2 model for the 2 specific bones on to the THAW model (6 & 17) and adjust as needed

Bone 0 is the root bone, this bone basically does nothing but dont mess with it

Bone 1 is the root bone for the actual skeleton as well as being the waist bone

Bone 2 is one of 3 spine bones, this one being the lowest

bone 3 is also one of the 3 spine bones, this one being the middle

Bone 4 is the last of the spine bones being towards the top

bone 5 is the left shoulder bone, basically is the shoulder blade of this skeleton

bone 6 is the lower part of the left upper arm (remember THAW did some weird stuff with the arm bones)

Bone 7 is the left fore arm

Bone 8 is the left wrist joint

Bone 9 is the bottom left hand "pinky-middle" finger joint

Bone 10 is the top left hand "pinky-middle" finger joint

Bone 11 is the bottom left hand "index" finger joint

Bone 12 is the top left hand "index" finger joint

Bone 13 is the left hand thumb joint

Bone 14 is a weird one, it seems to work hand-in-hand with bone 7 and 8 but isnt really important as long as the other 2 are rigged

Bone 15 this time around is one of the 3 upper arm bones, with this one being the middle bone generally

Bone 16 is a new bone, also one of the 3 upper arm bones, and this one is the top/last one, but it changes the order of the bones from here

Bone 17 is the right shoulder bone, basically is the shoulder blade of this skeleton

Bone 18 is the right upper arm

Bone 19 is the right fore arm

Bone 20 is the right wrist joint

Bone 21 is the bottom right hand "index" finger joint

Bone 22 is the top right hand "index" finger joint

Bone 23 is the bottom right hand "pinky-middle" finger joint

Bone 24 is the top right hand "pinky-middle" finger joint

Bone 25 is the right hand thumb joint

Bone 26 is a weird one, it seems to work hand-in-hand with bone 18 and 19 but isnt really important as long as the other 2 are rigged

Bone 27 this time around is one of the 3 upper arm bones, with this one being the middle bone generally

Bone 28 is a new bone, also one of the 3 upper arm bones, and this one is the top/last one, but it changes the order of the bones from here

Bone 29 is the neck joint

Bone 30 is the head joint

Bone 31 is the upper head joint

Bone 32 is the "hair" bone, this bone acts like hair in movement

Bone 33 is the nose bone, only really does anything on a CAS 

Bone 34 is the jaw bone, also only really does anything on a CAS and cutscenes

Bone 35 is the "boob" bone. this bone doesnt really do much from what I've seen but certain parts are rigged to it so idk

Bone 36 is one of the "shirt" bones, these are for something like the bottom of a shirt to make it seem a bit more alive

Bone 37 is one of the "shirt" bones, these are for something like the bottom of a shirt to make it seem a bit more alive

Bone 38 is one of the "shirt" bones, these are for something like the bottom of a shirt to make it seem a bit more alive

Bone 39 is the right thigh bone

bone 40 is the right calf bone

Bone 41 is the right main foot bone

Bone 42 is the right toe joint

Bone 43 is the left thigh bone

Bone 44 is the left calf bone

Bone 45 is the left main foot bone

Bone 46 is the left toe joint

With the board I'm not 100% sure but chances are theyre probably:

Bone 47 is the deck root bone

Bone 48 is the deck front half bone

Bone 49 is the front trucks bone

Bone 50 is the back deck bone

Bone 51 is back trucks bone
